# README File FOR game.c


* This Game is Tic-Tac-Toe:

* There is only 1 library is used in it according to my level of understanding.

* GAME RULES: 
                   > The game board contains 9 cells.
                   > Player 1 uses "X" while player 2 uses "O".
                   > Player choses numbers between 1-9.
                   > And remaining all the rules are already known to everyone. 


* PROGRAMMING USED:
                    > Normal 2D arrays' concepts are being used in this.
                    > I've used functions in this just to increase readibility of the code.
                    > Also wrote some comments for better understanding.
                    >> Normal functions like- "draw()" and "checkwin()" which are crystal clear in written code.
                    > If someone uses same number already being used then it'll show "invalid move!".

* MOTIVE:
                    > Motive of making this game was just to sharpen my understanding about arrays' concepts. 
                    


# CONCLUSION:

                    >> I took help of chatGPT for just starting ideas.
                    >> All the next concepts were mine.
                    >> made an easy game for just clearance of my doubts in 2D arrays.


~ In the end:
                    >> ENJOY THE GAME.
